// TO DO LIST

A) Create a new sort of collision to keep player from walking off edges
	* actions such as bow or hookshot or throw should still cross the tile
	* ^ these actions should still collide neatly with walls if doesn't already
	
B) I don't really like how items can be used while carrying something, although it is
necessary for the level design. Maybe look into changing that

C) I succesfully prevented pausing state when text boxes and room transitions are occuring
next i should try and pause the camera movement as well
